# 🔒 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES:
# 1. Create a .env.local file (git-ignored) with your actual values
# 2. Only use testnet wallets with test ETH - never mainnet keys
# 3. The private keys in hardhat node output are PUBLIC development keys
# 4. These development keys are safe to see as they're never used with real funds
# 5. Always verify you're deploying to testnet, not mainnet
# 6. Consider using hardware wallets for production deployments
